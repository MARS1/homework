When working collaboratively on a new product design it helps to reach out to team members and stakeholders early on to flesh out ideas faster, and generally speaking there is more consensus on the direction because everyone on the team has had an opportunity to put forth their input in the form of ideas, concerns, anxieties, fears, and expectations.

CenturyLink wanted to create a new security offering that would be readily accessible and easily understood by the common consumer, that has little to no interest or knowledge of technical security matters. This would involve UX research, and understanding about human behavior, their ideas, need, wants, and concerns that would play out in various contexts with various technologies.

The concept was to start with a mobile application and gradually move to a larger screen size, including TV; but the all the ideas were just notional. My task was to bring about a complete picture of whom the product was catered towards and how it would fit into those users daily lifestyles in a simple to use interface that would allow CenturyLink to enhance their customers understanding of the vital role they play in helping address the problem with security vulnerabilities in a quickly changing landscape.
  
My process usually begins with understanding whom are the users both internally and externally within an organization to uncover their unique roles, needs, and work flow processes in an attempt to understand their compartmentalized job requirements but also how that fits into the broader scope of when those work flows cross paths with other types of personas, while looking for the pain points that often lead to a loss in productivity if not properly addressed.
  
From stake holders, employees, and any other users I can have access to I would begin by sending out an optional survey to take a poll and get a feel for what people think and opine on specific matters, that can range from emotional responses, to what matters to them most; to try and get to the heart of what the project is trying to accomplish and how that jives with the users that are to be using the app.
  
## 1 - Getting a sense of what matters through polls

Polls are grouped in to relevant topics and generally are multiple choice:
Here is an example of a poll I used on this project: https://goo.gl/icsVqe


## 2 - Discovering the user via persona outlines

Personas are a great way to get the internal stakeholders input as to whom an application is being built for, everyone has a different idea of the user the application is intended to serve, but often have no idea how someone else on the team perceives this approach. Thus the reason for taking the time to create the personas to address false notions, target the real users, and give them an identity when referencing them throughout the design process.

Here is one persona I used for this project: https://goo.gl/SY8zYE


## 3 - Present results to the team

This process doesn’t always work out according to plan, for example some stakeholders can’t be bothered to look at results, most are incredibly busy, sometimes results don’t concur with agendas, and a host of other reasons. However for the most part team members, and stakeholders alike are generally very receptive to this initial stage albeit anxious to get to a visual point in the project, something a little more tangible. But in my experience every piece of the puzzle has a purpose, and often times the smallest pieces have the greatest impact on the larger scope of the project. The clear example in this case would be, how can one design an application without understanding who the user are and what their concerns are.

Here is an example of some of the ways I presented results in this case:

## 4 - Always start with sketches

Sketches are not always well received because again they aren’t the finished and perfectly polished end result, but allow a designer to instantly jot down ideas that occur at moments that one wouldn’t expect. One might say “couldn’t this be done in Illustrator or Sketch”, and the answer is yes, except that ideas don’t always come when you’re in front of a computer, and aren’t work risking to rely solely on memory. Also the benefit of sketching is the level of focus that the mind latches to when pen touches paper, and the concurrent ideas that follow and often branch from one single concept put down on paper. Its a timeless art form that I don’t believe will ever go away.

Here are some examples of sketches that often lead to notes, and other ideas:

## 5 - Begin with some Lo-Fidelity designs before going all in

This project fortunately already had a branding and color theme, so I could actually use some of those elements however there have been instances where grayscale does fine.

## 6 - User Work Flows and other tools used to communicate and collaborate with fellow team members. 

There are certain tools I use but certainly things like simple diagrams to explain how a user traverses through an application. Tools like Sketch, InvisionApp, Zeplin, and others help facilitate these conversations and create powerful processes for transferring assets and specs. Seeing is believing when it comes to an application design.

## 7 - Working on finishing touches, animations, and transitions

Part of this step happens early on in the design process, but the assets I have found get created farther along during the development process. Its at this point where providing some delight comes into play.

Here is an example animation, made in Sketch and animated in After Effects:

## 8 - Get the app in users hands

This is an ongoing process as new features and ideas are needed. No app is created in a vacuum and constant iterations and tweaks are often made but having gong through the steps to ensure a stronger foundation will make those adjustments more evolutionary then revolutionary. Ultimately all that matters is the user and their feedback and my job is to constantly advocate for the end-user when working on any project.

That sums up my outline and process for getting kicking off projects. Of course there are many other small details that glue these main steps together but that’s the high level view of how I get things done. However this doesn’t mean I work a “set-it-and-forget-it” process when designing, I always look for new ways to improve work flow processes that ultimately help make me a better team player, and a more knowledgeable advocate for the end-user.

Thank you.
